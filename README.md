# Yans BuildReport Viewer

A Unity package for analyzing and displaying Unity build reports within the Unity Editor.

## Overview

This package provides tools to load, parse, and visualize build reports generated by Unity. It includes:

- **CustomBuildReportProcessor**: Automatically analyzes build reports after a build completes.
- **BuildReportHierarchyBuilder**: Generates hierarchical `IBuildEntry` structures for different views (Files, PackedAssets, AssetUsage, StrippingInfo, BuildSteps).
- **BuildFilesHierarchyWindow**: Editor window with a multi-column tree view to explore report entries.
- **BuildHierarchyTreeView**: Custom `TreeView` for displaying `IBuildEntry` objects with columns for name, size, and additional data.
- **Entities**: Entry implementations (`BuildFileEntry`, `PackedAssetEntry`, `AssetUsageEntry`, `BuildStepEntry`, `BuildStepMessageEntry`, `SceneEntry`, `SimpleEntry`) that wrap build report data.
